A JavaScript/TypeScript library to create MQTT entities that are automatically discovered by Home Assistant.

## Features

- Easy creation of Home Assistant MQTT entities
- Automatic MQTT discovery configuration
- Supported entity types:
  - Binary Sensors
  - Buttons
  - Sensors
  - Switches
- TypeScript support with full type definitions
- Configurable availability reporting

## Installation

```bash
npm install mqtt2ha
```

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 22.4.0
- A running MQTT broker
- Home Assistant with MQTT integration enabled and discovery enabled

## Quick Start

See [example.ts](./test-environment/example.ts) for usage examples.

Here's a simple example of creating a motion sensor:

```typescript
import { BinarySensor, MqttSettings, DeviceConfiguration } from 'mqtt2ha';

// MQTT connection settings
const mqttSettings: MqttSettings = {
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 1883,
  username: 'your_username',
  password: 'your_password',
  client_name: 'my-mqtt-client'
};

// Device configuration
const device: DeviceConfiguration = {
  name: 'Room Sensor',
  manufacturer: 'My Company',
  model: 'Room Sensor v1',
  identifiers: 'room_sensor_1'
};

// Create a motion sensor
const motionSensor = new BinarySensor({
  mqtt: mqttSettings,
  component: {
    component: 'binary_sensor',
    name: 'Motion Sensor',
    device_class: 'motion',
    unique_id: 'motion_sensor_1',
    device
  }
});

// Write configuration to MQTT (required for discovery)
await motionSensor.writeConfig();

// Publish state changes
await motionSensor.setState(true);
```
